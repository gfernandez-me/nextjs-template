# Tables: Server-Side Patterns & URL-Driven State

## Core Principles
- Server is the source of truth for filter/sort/page state.
- Encode state in URL; page back/forward works.
- TanStack Table in manual mode for server-side tables; never loop-fetch in useEffect.
- Keep client components presentational/interactive only.

## Best Practices
- Use server components for data fetching and filtering.
- Use client filter components to update URL only.
- Use debounced updates for text inputs.
- Memoize expensive filter/table components.
- Avoid client-side fetching and complex state sync.
