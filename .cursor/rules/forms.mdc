# Forms: Canonical Pattern & Guardrails

## Core Principles
- Use Conform for all new forms with Zod schemas, colocated under `lib/validation/*`.
- Prefer Server Actions for mutations; client enhances UX only.
- Single source of truth: one Zod schema reused for client & server validation.
- Accessibility: every field must expose `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, and error id hooks provided by Conform.
- Errors: always render inline errors; toast notifications are optional.
- File inputs & checkboxes: use Conform helpers for value coercion.
- No custom `event.preventDefault()` for form submit unless necessary.
- RHF may be used only for complex uncontrolled components, still reuse the same Zod schema via resolver.
